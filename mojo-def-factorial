The user wants me to rewrite a selected portion of Mojo code. The instructions are to "annotate this mojo and fix any errors".

**Understanding:**
The selected code defines a `factorial` function in Mojo. There's an immediate error: the input parameter `n` is overwritten with the value `5`. This makes the function always calculate the factorial of 5, regardless of the input. The code also includes a check for negative input, which is good practice. The calculation itself seems correct. The `print(result)` statement inside the function might not be desired in all cases.

**Analysis:**
1. **Error 1: Overwriting input parameter:** The line `n = 5` overwrites the function's input. This needs to be removed.
2. **Annotation:** The code lacks comments explaining its purpose and the logic behind the steps. I should add comments to improve readability.
3. **Potential Improvement:** The `print(result)` statement might be better placed outside the function, depending on the intended use. However, the instructions only ask to fix errors and annotate, so I will leave it as is for now.

**Solution Formulation:**
1. Remove the line `n = 5`.
2. Add comments explaining the function's purpose, the negative input check, the initialization of `result` and `i`, and the loop logic.

**Solution Endpoint:**
The rewritten code will have the input parameter `n` used correctly and will include comments explaining the code.

**Reflection:**
The primary error was a simple oversight that significantly altered the function's behavior. Adding annotations improves the maintainability and understanding of the code. This exercise highlights the importance of carefully reviewing code for logical errors and ensuring it aligns with its intended purpose. ```
